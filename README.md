# makeheic.py
A crappy script that uses ffmpeg &amp; mp4box to convert pictures to heic.

~Yeah now I'm actually making it more than just a .bat file.~

## Requirements:
1. Python 3.9+
2. FFmpeg & FFprobe with libx265 biult-in.
3. Mp4box(GPAC) 2.0+
4. ImageMagick (only need for icc and animated webp workaround)
5. Exiftool if you need to copy exif

## Usage:
1. Drag and drop (will use default settings).
2. Command line

## Notice:
1. Scaling function is just for quick use, if you are serious about scaling quality, please use tools like GIMP.
